Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning

Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human is expected to live.It is affected by many factors such as: 
• Socioeconomic status including employment, income, education and economic wellbeing. The quality of the health system and the ability of people to access it; health behaviors such as tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, poor nutrition and lack of exercise.
• Social factors, genetic factors, and environmental factors including overcrowded housing, lack of clean drinking water and adequate sanitation, etc.

It is a typical Regression Machine Learning project.My idea to implement this project is to use a dataset containing data based on different countries.It includes  training the dataset on regression algorithms like Multiple Linear Regression,Decision tree,Random Forest.

## Scope of use

It will be easier to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population.
